# UFO Sightings Data Visualization Analysis and Interpretation

## About

This repository contains an interpretation, explanation, and reflection of the analysis of UFO sighting patterns and trends using data from the TidyTuesday UFO Sightings dataset. The project explores temporal and spatial distributions of reported UFO sightings through data visualization techniques.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to interpret, explain, and reflect on the ggplot2 code adapted from Dan Oehm's UFO Sightings visualization.

## Data Access

### Datasets Used

This project utilizes two publicly available datasets from the TidyTuesday project:

1.  UFO Sightings Dataset
    -   Description: Contains detailed records of reported UFO sightings including dates, times, locations, shapes, and descriptions
    -   Source: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2023/2023-06-20/ufo_sightings.csv>
    -   Access: Loaded directly via URL in the analysis script
2.  Places Dataset
    -   Description: Contains geographic and demographic information about sighting locations
    -   Source: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2023/2023-06-20/places.csv>
    -   Access: Loaded directly via URL in the analysis script

## How to Run the Code

1.  Fork and clone this repository
2.  Ensure all required packages are installed
3.  Ensure font files are in the `fonts/` directory
4.  Open and render `HW1.qmd` in RStudio
